What's New In Libevent SVN:

0. About this document

  This document describes the key differences between Libevent 1.4 and
  Libevent ???, from a user's point of view.  It was most recently
  updated based on features in subversion trunk as of 27 Dec 2007.

  NOTE 1: As of this writing, we haven't decided whether the trunk
  version of svn will turn into a 1.5 or 2.0.

  NOTE 2: If any features or fixes get backported from trunk to 1.4,
  they should get moved from here into whatsnew-14.txt, since they
  will no longer be differences between 1.4 and this version.

1. Packaging Issues.

2. New and Improved APIs

2.1. Overrideable allocation functions

  If you want to override the allocation functions used by libevent
  (for example, to use a specialized allocator, or debug memory
  issues, or so on), you can replace them by calling
  event_set_mem_functions.  It takes replacements for malloc(),
  free(), and realloc().

2.2. More flexible readline support

  The old evbuffer_readline() function (which accepted any sequence of
  CR and LF characters as a newline, and which couldn't handle lines
  containing NUL characters), is now deprecated.  The preferred
  function is evbuffer_readln(), which supports a variety of
  line-ending styles, and which can return the number of characters in
  the line returned.

2.3. Socket is now an abstract type

  All APIs that formerly accepted int as a socket type now accept
  "evutil_socket_t".  On Unix, this is just an alias for "int" as
  before.  On Windows, however, it's an alias for SOCKET, which can
  be wider than int on 64-bit platforms.

3. Big bugfixes

4. Big performance improvements

5. Removed code and features
